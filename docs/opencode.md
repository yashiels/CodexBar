# OpenCode provider

## Data sources
- Browser cookies from `opencode.ai`.
- OpenCode Go local history from `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` on macOS and Linux.
- `POST https://opencode.ai/_server` with server function IDs:
  - `workspaces` (`def39973159c7f0483d8793a822b8dbb10d067e12c65455fcb4608459ba0234f`)
  - `subscription.get` (`7abeebee372f304e050aaaf92be863f4a86490e382f8c79db68fd94040d691b4`)

## Usage mapping
- Primary window: rolling 5-hour usage (`rollingUsage.usagePercent`, `rollingUsage.resetInSec`).
- Secondary window: optional weekly usage (`weeklyUsage.usagePercent`, `weeklyUsage.resetInSec`).
- Resets computed as `now + resetInSec`.

## Notes
- Responses are `text/javascript` with serialized objects; parse via regex.
- Missing workspace ID or rolling usage fields should raise parse errors; omitted weekly usage stays absent.
- OpenCode web Auto imports Chrome first, then Dia when their cookie stores exist; Keychain preflight stays scoped
  to each candidate browser. Other browsers stay on Manual Cookie import until CodexBar has an explicit browser
  selector.
- Set `CODEXBAR_OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ID` to skip workspace lookup and force a specific workspace.
- Workspace override accepts a raw `wrk_…` ID or a full `https://opencode.ai/workspace/...` URL.
- Cached cookies: Keychain cache `com.steipete.codexbar.cache` (account `cookie.opencode`, source + timestamp). Browser
  import only runs when the cached cookie fails.
- OpenCode Go auto mode tries web usage first. Authentication/setup failures fall back to quota windows and daily cost
  history derived from local `opencode-go` assistant costs.
- OpenCode Go cost history chart: `opencode.ai` has no daily-granularity endpoint, so per-day cost/request buckets
  come from local `opencode-go` assistant costs in `opencode.db`, keyed by device-local calendar day. Successful web
  usage remains workspace-scoped and is never blended with device-wide local costs, so it does not show cost history.
  Explicit Web mode never reads the local database either.
